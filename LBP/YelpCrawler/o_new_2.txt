It was 7:45p, and they closed at 8:00pm.The manager was super nice and killed me with kindness. \xa0She went out of her way to explain things.I did not feel the rush vibe from the staff that normally occurs when showing up at a restaurant right before closing.I saw the manager accept customers that walked in 30-45 mins after closing.One of the customers was a black man, who was indecisive. \xa0She was patient and sweet to him, letting him take his time. He walked in at 8:30pm.I ate small Ribs, tiny portion of Pulled Pork, side of Potato Salad, side of Beans, and some Banana pudding.Ribs were definitely falling off the bone.Sauce was separate because each table had four BBQ sauce bottles to choose from. \xa0I used Spicy, which was good.Beans were excellent. \xa0Pulled Pork was tender. \xa0Potato Salad had large chunks of potatoes.Banana pudding was real good. It appeared to have Nilla Wafer cookies in it.Around 8:45pm, the Manager came within proximity. I asked her if she closed at 8:00pm. \xa0She said yes.I told her that most restaurants would give off a weird vibe that you need to leave because it was past closing.I said that she wasn&#39;t kicking anybody out. \xa0She said that her job wasn&#39;t to kick people out but to feed people.I thought that was cool.Check out this place and make your own judgement. They will not disappoint.One more thing, I am not white, I am a POC, and did not feel any racist vibes. \xa0I only felt the Manager&#39;s genuinely sweet caring of customers. \xa0She did say her job was to feed people.'), (u'TYhfP__5fO4LrNJXXRTubQ', 'OMD5H_FpUf4Z4XPrYg3eyQ', u'Paulette W.', '4.0', '6/5/2014', u'I was so glad to find this yummy restaurant less than 2 miles from my mom&#39;s home this week. I ordered a bbq sandwich and side of baked beans for myself, and a hamburger for mom. This was &#34;to go&#34; and the cashier warned that the burgers are made fresh, so I would have a little wait; a sign at the cash register gave that same warning. Both sandwiches were excellent and the side of beans was perfect for 2 to share. Worth the wait!There was a daily special of ham, collard greens, blackeyed peas, and cornbread. Those special sides could be ordered or substituted for the menu sides. Next time I will plan on a dessert; they looked wonderful and included banana pudding.In spite of a previous reviewers comments about racism, while waiting I observed a busy lunch hour that included a very diverse crowd and saw no difference in treatment of any of the customers.

Their Rib Sandwich is delicious as well. They have an original sauce and a spicy sauce and I must side with the spicy especially if you want that extra kick in taste.The sides are always really good. Fries, baked beans, and fried okra are all great choices. Their dessert options look amazing even though I&#39;ve never personally had any of them.This is THE place to eat if you&#39;re in the Leeds/Moody area.'), (u'szLJtrldeSBa6ckQW5hgLg', 'Gu6v8UP_FKORLlKyvc5JIg', u'May W.', '2.0', '3/24/2014', u'This place definitely deserves a Good, Bad, Ugly listing....GOOD- SMELL. As soon as you pull up into the parking lot, you&#39;re immediately greeted with the smell of cooking meat over fire. God, that always lets you know your taste buds are in for a treat.FOOD. 5 stars for the food. Ribs were amazing. Like everyone&#39;s been saying: fall off the bone tender. Surprised the sauce isn&#39;t actually on the meat but having it on the side was cool. We got a chance to try all the sauces. Sweet and original were my fave. Not a fan of the white at all (tasted like tartar sauce), but glad for the experience.Great homemade sides: deviled eggs (awesome- needed a dash of paprika), potato salad (perfect amount of mayo), and two types of baked beans: sweet and spicy (Sweet was earthy and really good. Spicy had a nice aftertaste.)DESSERTS. Homemade pies. BEST coconut cream pie I&#39;ve ever had. Found out it was a family recipe. You can definitely taste the love in there. The chocolate silk was definitely not of the no-baked variety. And my peanut butter pie was SICK; it was so good. Normally I don&#39;t like peanut butter pies because one bite, you feel like a lead weight has been dropped on your tummy. But their pie was light and fluffy and sooo good. The very best of Reeses peanut butter cups rolled into a homemade graham cracker crust.ROSEMARY BUSH. Right by the front door, there&#39;s a HUGE rosemary bush, carrying the scent of fresh rosemary into the air. We all stopped to smell the...rosemary. And it was awesome! Sure this place must smell divine in the summer.BAD- BATHROOM. Single stall. Old. Not very clean. Has definitely seen better days. Kicker was all that rust (at least I hope it&#39;s rust) *right* under the handle. Quite unsettling.UGLY- RACISM. Oh yeah, racism is still very alive and kicking in lil ol&#39; Leeds, AL. Granted growing up as a POC in the South, it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve had some first-hand experiences with. I can&#39;t help but be a little wary whenever I go to Southern Small Town, USA but honestly, I didn&#39;t think foodspotting AND yelp wouldn&#39;t have mentioned a HUGE side order we received there- free of charge.Background- I went there with two other friends: a white Hispanic girl and a black girl. As soon as we got in the door, my black friend was immediately given a disdainful look. We all ignored it since we were all starving, were just driving through and wanted to eat some of that delicious smelling meat we were smelling miles away.We place our order then go to find our seats in the dining room. The only other person in the place (older white guy- sure he&#39;s a regular) had this look of shock when he saw us go into the place. Glared at us the entire time we were getting our drinks then was barely concealing his anger when we sat down in the booth behind his. He immediately went to the other side of the room.KICKER: food comes. We inhale the wonderful smells and was just starting to really relax into the meal and the wonderful home-cooking when Rusty&#39;s mom shows up at our table. She was the one that had rung us up but was now checking on our table. She asked how we found out about the place. We immediately said yelp and foodspotting. Brief chitchat about the awesomeness of yelp then tells us that there&#39;s a BBQ contest throughout all of AL. She gives us a card with the website and instructions on how to vote. Handed the card to me and my Hispanic friend and THREW the card at my black friend. This was also after my black friend, who had the most interest in the contest, was asking her lots of questions about the contest. Questions were ignored and no eye contact given.We definitely left with a sour taste on our mouth. Normally Rusty&#39;s would the ideal place for me to visit. Mom and pop place, home cooking, family recipes, lots of love and pride in their ingredients and end product. The other servers were great. Very sweet and friendly. Rusty even came by our table to check up on us and told us bye when we were leaving.HOWEVER, Rusty&#39;s mom was our &#34;server&#34; for most of our experience. And judging from the reaction of their other customer that night (and from looking at all the other reviewers online), it&#39;s obvious they don&#39;t get a lot of non-whites that come in there to eat. And after this experience, we can definitely see why. My black friend was definitely not welcomed there.So to know that a simple detour off the interstate can cause you to step back 70 years in time was something that we didn&#39;t expected when we stopped for dinner that night. But that&#39;s exactly what we got. And that just makes me sad.'), (u'XEm1mugg7SdhZYWkkz_eEA', 'LZXCXxy2AUBNB32Ghgt22Q', u'Laura G.', '5.0', '8/3/2014', u'Rusty is a great chef who will make you feel at home.

My husband who is a huge banana pudding person LOVED their pudding. He even had a second order of it. I had the peanut butter pie. Super tasty and perfectly sweet. It even had peanuts in it.

While dining after the race, Charlie Kimball dropped in for dinner and hung out with the owner Rusty for a bit. He even signed some memorabilia like several other Indy stars who dropped by over the weekend did.The staff here are super nice and the restaurant is quite spacious with large booths and several round tables that can seat a good sized party. Easy access to Hwy 20 in both directions.Now I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve had barbeque from most parts of the South, but for some reason had never experienced Northern Alabama barbeque and the White Barbeque sauce. What a treat!I always order the same way when I try a new barbeque joint: give me what you do best! I loaded up a half and half plate of ribs and pulled pork with spicy beans and deviled eggs. Staff brought it over and told me about the 4 sauces on the table: house, spicy, sweet, and that white barbeque sauce. Now I&#39;ve had tomato and vinegar based barbeque before and am quite partial to it, but oh what a wonderful concoction of spice and texture Rusty has created. I was very pleased with how the sauce accentuated the pork and didnt drown the flavor. And the White sauce, well my Alabama friends said it&#39;s a staple (of which they apparently never told me). It was very unique and quite good. A vinegar and mayo base with mild spices to create a remoulade consistency. It paired well with both the ribs and pulled pork and a nice find all the way around.The spicy beans have a really nice kick, but not in a burning way. The pulled pork came with both tender and bark bits and was so wonderfully pink with the right amount of smoke. They do pork very well. The ribs were incredibly tender, just pulled right off the bone. Quite a bit of meat on them compared to most and very juicy. Tried the various sauces and even mixed them up a bit too. Was very pleased with the overall flavors created and will certainly recommend and head back this way!Stop by and give this crew your patronage.

Rusty&#39;s was recommended by the clerk at the hotel where I was staying. I ordered the rib and chicken combo plate with onion rings and fried okra.The ribs were smokey, meaty and delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked, but appeared to be baked instead of smoked or grilled, perhaps that&#39;s an Alabama thing? The onion rings and okra were cooked fresh to order and excellent!Rusty&#39;s has a variety of sauces: House, Sweet, Spicy and White. Being from Texas, I have never seen &#34;white&#34; BBQ sauce before. An employee informed me that it is a Northern Alabama &#34;delicacy&#34; with a mayo base. It was pretty good on the chicken, but is an acquired taste.BBQ is so regional in nature. In Texas, we have beef brisket and hot links and sausage. Not so in Alabama. Ribs, chicken and pulled pork are the specialties. That&#39;s OK, everybody has their own tastes.Personally, if I find myself in Leeds, AL again, I will definitely put Rusty&#39;s on my &#34;go to&#34; list for BBQ.

The staff is very friendly and always remembers us, as well as sitting us at our favorite booth where we sit everytime. We don&#39;t even have to ask anymore. They start you off with chips and salsa, and cheese if you ask. All three are fantastic. The chips are so tasty, always hot and fresh. The salsa isn&#39;t too spicy but has a kick and the cheese... well I could eat my entire weight in their cheese!! We always order the same thing - the boyfriend gets the Chicken Quesadilla and I the Burrito al Carbon (steak burrito SMOTHERED in their cheese... told you I love that cheese!!) Our meals always come out hot and fresh and we have never had one complaint. They always get your order correct, and come back numerous times to check up on you and see if you need anything.

My wife and I love BBQ so we thought we would give the new place in town a try. We went during the middle of the week and it wasn&#39;t very busy at all. When we arrived we sat down at a dirty table which a waitress promptly cleaned, we then proceeded to wait longer then normal for our drink/food order. Finally a different waitress that seemed VERY scattered arrived and took our order. We proceeded to wait longer then normal for our food but I noticed a lot of to go orders being delivered so I didn&#39;t complain. When our food finally arrived they only brought out 2 of the 3 orders...my wife had requested no green onions on her potato and of course they were on there and on top of that it had extremely too much sauce and butter. I ordered a smoked chicken salad...chicken was flavorful dressing was substandard. As my wife and I continued to eat, my 3 year old son&#39;s hot dog and fries still hadn&#39;t arrived. We waited and waited and waited...finally a waitress over heard us talking about it and went to get it for us. Fries were soggy and stone cold, bun was cold, hot dog looked deep fried and not grilled. Throughout our visit there we never really knew who our waitress was, nobody came back to check on us, ticket was wrong when they brought it out, and food was substandard.
